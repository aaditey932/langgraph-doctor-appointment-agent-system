# ü©∫ Doctor Appointment System

An intelligent multi-agent system for managing doctor appointments using LangGraph, FastAPI, and Streamlit. The system leverages LLM-powered conversational agents with ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) framework to handle appointment booking, cancellation, rescheduling, and availability inquiries through natural language interactions.

## ‚ú® Features

### Multi-Agent Architecture
- **Supervisor Agent**: Central coordinator that analyzes user intent and routes requests using structured LLM output
- **Information Agent**: Specialized for handling availability queries and FAQs with dedicated tools
- **Booking Agent**: Manages all appointment operations (create, cancel, reschedule) with data validation

### Intelligent Conversation Management
- **Natural Language Processing**: Users can interact in plain English without specific command syntax
- **Intent Recognition**: Automatic classification of user requests (information vs booking operations)
- **Context Awareness**: Maintains conversation state and prevents infinite loops
- **Structured Decision Making**: Type-safe routing with reasoning explanations

### Comprehensive Appointment Management
- **Real-time Availability Checking**: Query by specific doctor name or medical specialization
- **Full CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, and delete appointments
- **Data Validation**: Pydantic models ensure proper date formats and valid doctor/specialization selection
- **Conflict Prevention**: Checks availability before booking to prevent double-booking

### User Interface
- **Web-based Frontend**: Clean Streamlit interface with form inputs and real-time responses
- **REST API**: FastAPI backend with automatic documentation and validation
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error management with user-friendly messages

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

### Core Framework
- **LangGraph**: Multi-agent workflow orchestration with state management
